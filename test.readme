Thanks for clarifying! Let me adjust the workflow to account for this distinction.

Updated Explanation and Calculation Workflow
Understanding the Revenue Structure:
Total Earnings: The total income generated from all entry fees across all competitions.
Expenses:
Prizes: The payouts for firstPrize, secondPrize, and thirdPrize for each competition.
User Share (75%): This applies only to competitions created by users (not the admin). The user who creates a competition earns 75% of that competition’s earnings.
2. Steps to Calculate Total Earnings:
Calculate the total earnings from entry fees for all competitions.
Formula: Total Earnings = Sum(entryFee × number of participants) for all competitions
3. Steps to Calculate Total Expenses:
Sum of Prize Payouts:

Calculate the total prize payout by summing up the firstPrize, secondPrize, and thirdPrize for each competition.
Formula: Total Prize Payouts = Sum(firstPrize + secondPrize + thirdPrize) for all competitions
Sum of User Shares (75%) for User-Created Competitions:

For each competition created by a user, calculate 75% of its earnings.
Formula for user-created competitions: User Share = 75% × (entryFee × number of participants)
Sum this amount for all user-created competitions.
Total Expenses:

Combine the total prize payouts and the user shares.
Formula: Total Expenses = Total Prize Payouts + Sum(User Share for user-created competitions)
4. Calculate Admin Earnings:
Competitions created by the admin do not have the 75% share paid out; the admin keeps 100% of those earnings.
Admin Earnings:
Admin-created competition earnings: Total Earnings from admin-created competitions
Formula for admin-created competitions: Admin Earnings = Entry fee × number of participants for all admin-created competitions
5. Calculate Net Revenue:
Combine the total earnings and total expenses to calculate the net revenue.
Net Revenue Formula: Net Revenue = Total Earnings - Total Expenses
6. Full Calculation Workflow:
Collect Data:

Identify the competitions created by users and those created by the admin.
Get the entryFee, number of participants, and prize amounts for each competition.
Calculate Total Earnings:

Sum the earnings from all competitions.
Calculate Total Prize Payouts:

Sum the prize payouts for each competition.
Calculate Total User Share:

Calculate 75% of earnings only for user-created competitions and sum them.
Calculate Admin Earnings:

Sum the earnings from competitions created by the admin (100% of those earnings).
Calculate Total Expenses:

Total Expenses = Total Prize Payouts + Sum(User Share for user-created competitions)
Calculate Net Revenue:

Net Revenue = Total Earnings - Total Expenses
Example Calculation:
Suppose you have:

Competition 1 (user-created): Entry fee = $10, 100 participants, firstPrize = $100, secondPrize = $50, thirdPrize = $30.
Competition 2 (admin-created): Entry fee = $5, 50 participants, firstPrize = $80, secondPrize = $40, thirdPrize = $20.
Total Earnings:

Competition 1: $10 × 100 = $1,000
Competition 2: $5 × 50 = $250
Total Earnings = $1,000 + $250 = $1,250
Total Prize Payouts:

Competition 1: $100 + $50 + $30 = $180
Competition 2: $80 + $40 + $20 = $140
Total Prize Payouts = $180 + $140 = $320
Total User Share (for user-created competitions):

Competition 1: 75% × $1,000 = $750
Total User Share = $750
Admin Earnings:

Competition 2: 100% × $250 = $250
Total Expenses:

Total Expenses = $320 (prizes) + $750 (user share) = $1,070
Net Revenue:

Net Revenue = $1,250 (earnings) - $1,070 (expenses) = $180
